# Random Numbers

### Create a RandomList component with a button `show number`. 
- When clicking the button, one random integer between 0 and 99 will show up. 
- Clicking the button again, another random integer will show up below the previous number. (not replaced by the new one)
- You can achieve this by storing the array of numbers using `useState`. 
- The initial state should be an empty array.
- Come up with an idea to keep the old values in the array as well as the new one.
